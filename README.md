# SFML Game
Spaghettified attempt at replicating an all time masterpiece flash web game Fly Hard

# Instalation
Game is already compiled, just donwload the repo and run the executable(100% virus free ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) )
Otherwise you can also take out the source .cpp/.hpp files and compile them in your trusty visual studio with a MingW64-bit library found [here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/files/SFML-2.5.1-windows-gcc-7.3.0-mingw-64-bit.zip)

# What could be better and what should be added
 - Whole code is a mess as i was learning SFML syntax progressively, so a big despaghettification is required </br>
 - Add more sounds than just a music, like win/lose sound on Game Over screen</br>
 - Add a menu, where you can set up volume of music and sound, maybe localization</br>
 - Change enemy sprites based on their altitude</br>
 - Make more sophisticated spawning mechanic</br>
 - Tweak out all the unbalanced "features"(fuel spawning too close, altitude gain is not equivalent to the speed of the craft, etc..)</br>
 
 # My thoughts on this project
 The final product is horendous, but i learned a thing or two(more like 19) that i would do differently next time that would make the code actualy viable and save me a lot of time.
